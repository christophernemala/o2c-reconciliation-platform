# 💼 O2C Reconciliation Platform

An automated tool for reconciling Accounts Receivable (AR) with Bank Statements. This platform helps you match invoices with bank payments quickly and accurately.

## 🌟 What Does This Do?

This tool helps you:
- **Upload** AR and Bank statement Excel files
- **Automatically match** records based on customer name, amount, and date
- **Identify** unmatched records that need attention
- **Export** results to Excel for further analysis
- **Calculate** aging for overdue invoices

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Excel Files

**AR File should have these columns:**
- Customer Name
- Amount
- Invoice Number
- Date

**Bank File should have these columns:**
- Customer Name
- Amount
- Reference
- Date

### Step 2: Open the Platform

1. Go to: https://christophernemala.github.io/o2c-reconciliation-platform/
2. Click "Upload AR File" and select your AR Excel file
3. Click "Upload Bank File" and select your Bank Excel file
4. Click "Process Reconciliation"

### Step 3: Review Results

The platform will show you:
- ✅ **Matched Records**: Successfully reconciled transactions
- ⚠️ **Unmatched AR**: Invoices without matching bank payments
- ⚠️ **Unmatched Bank**: Bank payments without matching invoices

### Step 4: Export Results

Click "Export to Excel" to download a report with all results in separate sheets.

## 🔧 How It Works (For Learning)

### 1. **index.html** - The Structure
This file creates the webpage layout:
- Upload buttons for files
- Tables to display results
- Buttons to process and export

Think of it like building a house - HTML is the walls and rooms.

### 2. **styles.css** - The Design
This file makes everything look good:
- Colors and gradients
- Button styles
- Table formatting
- Responsive design for mobile

Think of it like painting and decorating the house.

### 3. **app.js** - The Brain
This file does all the work:

**Reading Files:**
```javascript
// Reads Excel file and converts to data we can work with
function readExcelFile(file) { ... }
```

**Matching Logic:**
```javascript
// Compares AR and Bank records to find matches
function performReconciliation() {
    // Check if customer names match
    // Check if amounts match (within 1 cent)
    // Check if dates are close (within 7 days)
}
```

**Displaying Results:**
```javascript
// Shows matched records in a table
function displayMatchedRecords() { ... }
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Code

### Key Concepts:

**1. Variables** - Store data
```javascript
let arData = [];      // Stores AR records
let bankData = [];    // Stores Bank records
```

**2. Functions** - Do specific tasks
```javascript
function parseAmount(value) {
    // Converts "$1,234.56" to 1234.56
}
```

**3. Loops** - Repeat actions
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < arData.length; i++) {
    // Check each AR record
}
```

**4. Conditions** - Make decisions
```javascript
if (amountMatch && customerMatch) {
    // Records match!
}
```
